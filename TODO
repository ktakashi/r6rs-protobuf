Things I thought not pretty.

- It uses generate-temporaries to make unique symbol however some 
  implementations (e.g. Vicare) generates non portable representative
  symbols. Thus, the generated code won't be portable.
- Lexer doesn't allow /* */ style comment.
- Toplevel(?) `option` is not allowed.
- symbol after package is not allowed.
- Holding record type on a slot of a record isn't portable on R6RS. This
  fails at least Chez and Mosh(Psyntax).

... maybe so on
