protoc-scm
==========

This script is a GNU Guile front-end to the R6RS Protocol Buffers compiler, and
is intended as a substitute for the `protoc' tool provided in the official 
Google Protocol Buffers distribution. Its usage is likewise similar to that of
`protoc':

  $> protoc-scm [OPTION ...] PROTO_FILE ...

`protoc-scm' parses the specific .proto files, resolving imports relative to
the current working directory (and any paths specified by the `-I' option) and
writes the correspondingly-generated Scheme code to the path given by the 
required `--scm_out' directive, creating sub-directories as necessary, rooted 
at that location.

For example, the following invocation of `protoc-scm':

  $> protoc-scm --scm_out=. Test.proto

...will parse and compile the Test.proto definition, and create the file (and
parent directories):

  protobuf/default/Test.scm

...underneath the current working directory.
